# Exercises

## Exercises 1: Preliminaries

The goals of [Exercises 1](exercises01-SDS383D.pdf) are: 
- to provide you with a review of Bayesian updating in simple conjugate families  
- to treat the multivariate normal distribution in some depth.  Since this distribution is so fundamental to working with hierarchical Bayesian models, it's worth the effort.  

By January 31, please complete the first two sections, on "Bayesian inference in simple conjugate families" and "The multivariate normal distribution".

By February 2, please complete the section on "Multiple regression: three classical principles for inference."  

By Feb 7: please have the section on "Some practical details" ready for class.  Be ready to show code.  


## Exercises 2: GLMs

The goals of [Exercises 2](exercises02-SDS383D.pdf) are: 
- to review (or, depending on your prior training, introduce) exponential families.    
- to construct and understand the basic properties of generalized linear models (GLMs)  
- to fit GLMs "from scratch," comparing gradient descent and Newton's method.  

Expected timeline:  
- By Feb 9: Exponential families, A through D  
- By Feb 14: Generalized linear models, A through C  
- By Feb 16: Fitting GLMs, A through C  
- By Feb 21: Fitting GLMs, D through G  

## Exercises 3: Bayes and the Gaussian linear model  

The goals of [Exercises 3](exercises03-SDS383D.pdf) are: 
- to introduce the normal/inverse-gamma conjugate prior for a location-scale model.    
- to construct and fit a simple Bayesian linear model from scratch, based on normal/inverse-gamma conjugacy.  
- to introduce hierarchical modeling, in the form of a regression model with heteroskedastic error.  

Expected timeline TBA, but as a starting point:  
- By Feb 23: aim to finish the section on "A simple Gaussian location model"

## Exercises 2: Bayes and the Gaussian linear model  

The goal of [Exercises 2](exercises02-SDS383D.pdf) is to get you comfortable with the use of conjugate priors in Gaussian models.  It finishes with a cool use of hierarchical modeling to fit a regression model with heavy-tailed errors.  


## Exercises 3: Linear smoothing and Gaussian processes

The goal of [Exercises 3](exercises03-SDS383D.pdf) is to equip you with some simple building blocks for nonlinear curve fitting.  Yes, it turns out that "linear smoothing" is used for nonlinear curve fitting -- this sounds like a contradiction, but you'll see what it entails and why it makes sense.  Here both Bayesian and frequentist approaches feature equally.  

There are a handful of optional problems in these exercises (clearly marked), which I will present in class myself. 


## Exercises 4: Hierarchical models  

The goal of [Exercises 4](exercises04-SDS383D.pdf) is to get you lots of practice fitting hierarchical models to different data-analysis problems.  

The following papers/readings provide useful background for this section.  I'll add to this list as appropriate:  
- [Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/taumain.pdf) by Gelman; and, optionally, [On the half-Cauchy prior for a global scale parameter](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1354024466), by Polson and Scott.   
- [The normal-Wishart prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-inverse-Wishart_distribution), from Wikipedia (or any similar source).  Kevin Murphy also has [some useful notes](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Papers/bayesGauss.pdf) that summarize this distribution; see Section 8 in particular.   
- [Bayesian analysis of binary and polychotomous response data](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~brian/905-2009/all-papers/albert-chib-1993.pdf), by Albert and Chib.  
- [Fitting mixed-effects models by REML](http://web.mit.edu/xiuming/www/docs/tutorials/ReML.pdf).  [How it works in the lme4 R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/Theory.pdf).  
- [Simon Jackman's paper on spatial voting models](https://academic.oup.com/pan/article-abstract/9/3/227/1453708/Multidimensional-Analysis-of-Roll-Call-Data-via).  You can find an application of this framework in [our paper on family-planning legislation in the Texas Legislature.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26794846)
