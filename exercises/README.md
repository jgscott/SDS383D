## Exercises 1: Preliminaries

The goal of [Exercises 1](exercises01-SDS383D.pdf) is to provide you with a review of two basic ideas:  
- Bayesian updating in simple conjugate families  
- frequentist approaches to uncertainty quantification  

It will also treat the multivariate normal distribution in (possibly excruciating) depth.  But since this distribution is so fundamental to working with hierarchical Bayesian models, it's worth the effort.  

## Exercises 2: Bayes and the Gaussian linear model  

The goal of [Exercises 2](exercises02-SDS383D.pdf) is to get you comfortable with the use of conjugate priors in Gaussian models.  It finishes with a cool use of hierarchical modeling to fit a regression model with heavy-tailed errors.
